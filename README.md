# Explore Transport Campaign Project

## Disclaimer
The logos and images in this project are the property of the New Zealand Tourism and related associations (100% Pure New Zealand, Tiaki - Care for New Zealand, Tourism Industry Aotearoa) and the Explore Vehicle Rentals logo was created by myself for this academic project. All images have been used for academic purposes only while studying at Yoobee College. This is not a commercial website, and this project code is the property of Marian Arnot.

## Foundation Coding Assignment
The aim of this project was to create a single page web application. This project allows users to input information, validate the information, display data in an appropriate format based on the information entered and provide feedback when validation has failed or passed.

## Project Overview
I created a website campaign as an extension of Tourism New Zealandâ€™s application using their branding theme and feel. 
The first part of the user experience involves visitors to the site inputting information and being shown transport options based on the number of people in their party and the length of time they intend to be traveling.
The second part involves calculating the transport costs including fuel consumption based on the type of vehicle chosen and the distance to travel.

## Mapbox
For branch locations I used Mapbox, an alternative to Google Maps.
